# 🧸 Tick Bear – Cute. Quirky. Clickable.

Super excited to share my mini frontend project — **Tick Bear** 🐻💥  
A tiny, ticked-off teddy that reacts when clicked!  
Originally built on CodePen, now hosted on GitHub Pages.

- 🎭 Shows different moods with animations  
- 🖥️ Fully responsive and lightweight
